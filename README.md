# Non-Angular + Webpack

This repo is an non-angular application, which added a third party library cornerstone to do window leveling on image.

1. Before run the application, install:

- node: 6.11.3
- yarn: 0.24.5

2. Use command `yarn install` to install `node_modules`

3. Run command `yarn run start` to run the application

4. Because of CORS issue during access the cloud image (see details: http://rawgit.com/chafey/cornerstoneWebImageLoader/master/examples/index.html), open a new terminal and do the following steps to fix it:

   4.1 run `mkdir /tmp/chrome_dev_session` to create chrome_dev_session folder under tmp
   
   4.2 run `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_session" --disable-web-security` to start a Chrome without security check.

5. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` in new started Chrome.

6. Click "window leveling" button multiple times, the time cost of for loop from cornerstone library will output in the console. The performance is not good.
